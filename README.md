## docco-husky-brunch
Adds [docco-husky](https://github.com/mbrevoort/docco-husky) support to [brunch](http://brunch.io).
It will generate documentation for javascript files in the /app directory

At the moment, the plugin is not available on npm so you have to use the tarball available on GitHub.

## Usage
Add `"docco-husky-brunch": "https://github.com/jcruz2us/docco-husky-brunch/tarball/master"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.


docco-husky relies on Pygments, so don't forget to install [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)...
