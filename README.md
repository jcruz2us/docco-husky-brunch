## docco-brunch
Adds docco-husky support to [brunch](http://brunch.io).

At the moment, the plugin is not available on npm so you have to use the tarball available on GitHub.

## Usage
Add `"docco-husky-brunch": "https://github.com/jcruz2us/docco-husky-brunch/tarball/master"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.
